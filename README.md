**Risk in deployment** | <ul><li> Bias (Dataset does not reflect facial recognition not working properly for example)<li> Fairness, History dataset is reality or not<li> Unethical aspects or Unfair usage</ul>
**Regulatory aspects** | <ul><li> Region specific needs (e.g. GDPR etc.)</ul>
**Provide clarity as much as possible** | <ul><li> What is happening from Step 1 to Step N<li> Features used during feature engineering process<li> Any information regarding feature importance / Top N features (as per applicability)</ul>
**How to approach Bias in AI** | <ul> <li> Gather more diverse datasets <li> Explore to include labels from a wider range of judges <li> Monitor output of models / experiments / algorithms <li> Focus on small categories and edge cases <li> Laws and Regulation protocol may be required to address bias </ul>

## Principles from the Ethical Institute

The Ethical institute has recommended following principles
- Human Augmentation
- Bias Evaluation
- Explainability by Justification
- Reproducible Operations
- Displacement Strategy
- Practical Accuracy
- Trust by Privacy
- Security Risks

Please check [here](https://ethical.institute/)

As per HBR (Harvard Business review), the ethical frameworks for AI aren't enough. [Check Here](https://hbr.org/2020/11/ethical-frameworks-for-ai-arent-enough)

## Machine Learning Roadmap

![ML Roadmap](/figure/CRISP_DM.png)

- Focus on every stages in the ML journey
- Critical to highlight on detailing and what tasks are performed in a step wise manner

## Why do we need ML Interpretability?

- Some questions pertaining to Model bias, fairness, ethics
- Do we check causality of features? Does more data help here making better decision?
- Do we have ability to debug and know more specifics
- Are there any regulatory requirements associated with and needs to be understood in detail?
- Do we trust model's outcomes and to what extent?
- Do we have a segregation of critical domain vs non-critical domain that can be defined?

## Bias - Different Types
This [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.10002.pdf) can be followed for 6 different types of Bias in AI.

- Historical Bias
- Representation Bias
- Measurement Bias
- Aggregation Bias
- Evaluation Bias
- Deployment Bias

## Fairness and Model Explainability CHECKLIST
- This is needed at CRISP-DM stages from a holistic point of view (Kind of a Checklist)
- Problem Formation
  - Is an algorithm an ethical solution to the problem?
- Construction of Datasets / Preparation Process
  - Is the training data representative of different groups so that we have diverse data representation for appropriate analysis of feature presence?
  - Are there biases in labels or features?
  - Does the data need to be modified to mitigate bias?
- Selection of Algorithms or Methods
  - Do fairness constraints need to be included in the objective function?
- Training Process
- Testing Process
  - Has the model been evaluated using relevant fairness metrics?
- Deployment
  - Is the model deployed on a population for which it was not trained or evaluated?
  - Are there unequal effects across users?
- Monitoring / HITL
  - Does the model encourage feedback loops that can produce increasingly unfair outcomes?

## Policy Related Guidance

Key Objectives could be as follows fro  Policy / Governance / Regulatory related frameworks:
- Safeguard consumer interest in an AI solution
- Serve as a common, global, consistent reference point
- Foster innovation and more robust solutions

**Frameworks:**
- [Singapore Model AI Governance Framework](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Help-and-Resources/2020/01/Model-AI-Governance-Framework) - by Personal Data Protection Commision, Singapore
- [Scotland AI Strategy](https://github.com/kkm24132/EthicalAI/blob/master/figure/Scotland_AI_Strategy.pdf): Scotland launched its National AI Strategy and announced that the government is formally adopting the policy guidance. It is the first country to do so and a unique opportunity for advocacy and engagement with policymakers on this topic. The AI strategy also highlights the Scottish Government’s work with the Data for Children Collaborative, a joint partnership between UNICEF and the University of Edinburgh’s Data Driven Innovation Programme, which investigates ways of using data to improve the lives of children around the world.
